      <p> Hi, I am Popy Chowdhury, I am posting here my Web design homework. This is assignment 1</p>
  
<h2>Google is My Favorite Webpage</h2>
<p> My favourite web page is Google. It is known for creating and running one of<br>
  the largest search engines on the worldwide. Every day more than a billion people<br>
  search the world's information, including webpages, images, videos and more. It is <br>
  considered one of the big four technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, and<br>
  Facebook.<br>
  <br>
  Google has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking for.<br>
  Google works just great if you have multiple devices – it’s more than felicitous, <br>
  especially the iPhone operating system. I can straight away continue right where I <br>
  left off, be it tabs, sites which need my password, etc. It’s all there. This makes <br>
  things easy for me on ios. Google Chrome is my preferred browser there too.</p>
